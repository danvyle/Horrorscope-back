mercury_capricorn = Retrograde.create(name: "mercury", explanation: "Uh oh, progress has slowed to a halt and your master plan has hit a snag. You'd rather do just about anything than sit there twiddling your thumbs when there's real work to be done. Having to depend on other people (like the IT guy) to finish their job before you can restart yours is excruciating. Plus, as a cardinal sign, you're used to taking the reins and doing it yourself, so not being in control of your own success or failure drives you nuts. Find some zen as you press reset.", sign_id:1)
mercury_aquarius = Retrograde.create(name: "mercury", explanation: "As the high-tech junkie and gadget guru of astrology, this retrograde cycle is a particularly annoying time for you. When your go-to devices are on the fritz, you just might be forced to *gasp* find alternate ways to source your information. Luckily, you're an outgoing innovator who likes a challenge, so you may come out of Mercury retrograde with some excellent new contacts or skills to help you get ahead. Making adjustments and adapting is everything right now, and you excel at it.", sign_id:2)
mercury_pisces = Retrograde.create(name: "mercury", explanation: "Your intuition is usually on point, Pisces, but during Mercury retrograde your guesses and 'feelings' are just off. With your psychic and intuitive abilities out of whack, the mix-ups that can result leave you feeling confused and out of sorts. After all, if you can't trust your gut, what can you trust? Escape, whether to your happiest of daydreams, favorite secluded beach, or beautifully curated Instagram feed, won't be easy right now either. This troubling time will require all of your creative abilities to find real solutions.", sign_id:3)
mercury_aries = Retrograde.create(name: "mercury", explanation: "You like to put your foot on the gas and move at warp speed toward your destination, so what happens when you can't? When you hit a road closed or detour sign, your temper flares. You get exasperated to the nth degree and you'll probably want to hit something. Violence isn't the answer, but you won't like what is: Patience. With Mercury retrograde, this is one time when you can't use your sheer force to get what you want. The more you push, the worse you fail.", sign_id:4)
mercury_taurus = Retrograde.create(name: "mercury", explanation: "You aren't used to being impatient, so this retrograde cycle really throws you for a loop. Not only are things not going that well, but now your typically calm attitude is off too. Frustrating, right? Usually careful and considered, you make impulsive decisions during Mercury retrograde which just doesn't jive with your rational way of going about things. One of the biggest bummers? You miss that close, personal communication with the people you care about. When planned get-togethers go awry, you may blame the wrong people or things. Avoid misplaced anger.", sign_id:5)
mercury_gemini = Retrograde.create(name: "mercury", explanation: "Mercury is your ruler, so when it goes retrograde your whole world is thrown off. On a positive note, you're a mutable sign who sees change (even bad) as a chance to make improvements. When Mercury retrograde puts up a roadblock, you just find an alternate route to get where you need to go. TBH, when you're not in too big of a hurry, you welcome the challenge. Prepare for your precious social media apps to be down, though, Gemini. Ouch.", sign_id:6)
mercury_cancer = Retrograde.create(name: "mercury", explanation: "Get ready for emotional overload. The more information (or misinformation) you're bombarded with, the more tempted you are to retreat into your shell - but that only prolongs the inevitable. Moody doesn't even begin to describe how you'll feel as you attempt to deal with the chaos that can be caused by Mercury retrograde. And when things in your beloved home break down, you may start to spin out. Your attempts to insulate yourself from the effects could backfire. You want to remain gentle, nurturing, and loving, but this is a trying time for you.", sign_id:7)
mercury_leo = Retrograde.create(name: "mercury", explanation: "While it's no secret that you love to be the center of attention, your worst fear is to be in front of a group of people and have something go wrong. Enter Mercury retrograde. This can cause presentations to fizzle and meetings to get off track, all due to things that aren't even within your control. The teleconferencing signal gets lost, or your phone decides to reboot for no reason whatsoever. Contacts may also be lost, causing embarrassment when you need to get in touch with friends or colleagues. Back everything up and think through your plans thoroughly.", sign_id:8)
mercury_virgo = Retrograde.create(name: "mercury", explanation: "You hate disorder, so this can be an ugly scenario for you, Virgo. As your ruler, Mercury being retrograde feels like a betrayal from within. The things you can normally count on to get you through your day - order, routine, etc. - are gone, replaced by chaos and uncertainty. Without organization, reliability, and careful analysis, what are your options? Lean into your mutable sign's adaptability and your earth sign's knack for staying grounded.", sign_id:9)
mercury_libra = Retrograde.create(name: "mercury", explanation: "Most Librans value their relationships above all else, but Mercury retrograde can cut you off from the people who are your lifelines. Now what?! The way you're used to communicating (social media, text, phone, etc.) may be spotty, so you'll have to find alternative ways to keep in touch. Since negotiations of all kinds can also be thrown off, pay close attention to contracts and agreements. All of the old friends, former coworkers, and exes appearing now can be good or bad news depending on how you ended things the first time.", sign_id:10)
mercury_scorpio = Retrograde.create(name: "mercury", explanation: "As a fixed sign, you don't really enjoy the ups and downs that life can throw your way. You're not going to be first in line to ride the Mercury retrograde rollercoaster, but if you have no choice, you're resourceful enough to take each curve as it comes. You're also wise enough to know that even though it may be unpleasant, it has to end sometime. Patient Scorpio can endure almost anything (yes, even giving up that beloved sense of control) as long as you know it will stop eventually.", sign_id:11)
mercury_sagittarius = Retrograde.create(name: "mercury", explanation: "This retrograde cycle gets you where it really hurts, Sagittarius: your ability to go, go, go. Mercury retrograde is notorious for messing with anything that helps get you where you need (or really want) to go. Bikes, buses, cars, planes, and trains can experience mechanical failures and other general difficulties, resulting in lost time and missed connections. Public transportation, traffic, and travel apps can be hit or miss, so make alternate plans and be prepared to slow down for once.", sign_id:12)


mars_capricorn = Retrograde.create(name: "mars", explanation: "It would be entirely reasonable for Capricorns to wince before, during, and after reading their horoscopes these days: with Pluto and Saturn already in your sign, providing pressures on all fronts, you may have gotten used, or even resigned yourself, to be the personal punching bag of astrology. Although the Mars retrograde is happening in your sign, and thus portends a certain level of intensity, the news is not all bad. Essentially, the Mars retrograde in Aquarius and Capricorn is coming for your money, honey: what it means to you, and what you do with it. You may also take off on tangents related to your self-worth and the tie that binds internal and external value. The Mars-Uranus squares are likely to have you chomping at the bit to spend it like it’s hot; perhaps the trick may be to find a healthy, happy medium for financial indulgences – investing in your creativity, for example, or developing a system of incremental rewards tied to achieving your saving goals. Don’t be too harsh on yourself though; Goats, like girls, just wanna have fun.", sign_id:1)
mars_aquarius = Retrograde.create(name: "mars", explanation: "In times like these, I’m often reminded of an old joke: ‘Just when I thought I hit rock bottom, I heard knocking from below.’ You’ll be hearing plenty of knocking from below this Mars retrograde, as Mars sets off spelunking into some mighty dark caverns, poking and prodding you in the most sensitive of places. Things will have been turbulent as of late, as you’ve had eclipses occurring in your sign for the last eighteen months; while the average Aquarian can handle more than its fair share of shifting, you may be suffering from change fatigue. The Mars retrograde in your sign, as well as Capricorn, is here to dredge up something awfully important: with your permission, he intends to reconnect you with who you are, and why you do – or undo, as it were – the things you do, the implication being that these proclivities could do with an edit. The Mars-Uranus squares may prompt swift adjustments in matters of home and family, or help you break free of the same.", sign_id:2)
mars_pisces = Retrograde.create(name: "mars", explanation: "The Mars retrograde in Aquarius and Capricorn is a mental exam in the making for Pisces. Akin to having a devil on one shoulder and an angel on the other, you may find yourself betwixt and between two very different impulses, one of which is anchored in optimism, and the other which seeks to leave you unmoored in a sea of doubt. Wavering between these two states may feel tiring, and indeed, you may need to schedule some downtime during the Mars retrograde to refresh, allowing you more perspective to reassess your social circle. Some members of your entourage may be revealed as more frenemy than friend; with Mars around, you may decide to send them packing. The Mars-Uranus squares will quicken your mind, electrifying your thoughts with sudden bursts of intuitive knowing about your deepest pains. As part of this, a new urge may arise to form a community with other like-minded folks, who share similar wounds and wisdom.", sign_id:3)
mars_aries = Retrograde.create(name: "mars", explanation: "Rams have been in an intense phase of career responsibility and advancement since Saturn entered Capricorn in late 2017. To top it off, Pluto has been a longtime resident of this part of your chart, eviscerating any hopes you may have held about squeaking by half-heartedly in your career. Now, you’ll be contending with the Mars retrograde as it trots across the parts of your chart connecting your career and reputation to your aspirations. Some of you may be weighing up new forays into group spaces or reconsidering existing collective work, while others may find themselves called wondering how to align their day job with profound new daydreams. Part of the work here is to study your motivations to ensure they’ll go the distance; the Mars-Uranus squares will serve to highlight how new financial needs may play into this budding picture.", sign_id:4)
mars_taurus = Retrograde.create(name: "mars", explanation: "Taureans have already been in a process of accelerated transformation since Uranus entered your sign mid-May 2018. The Mars retrograde will serve to amplify the necessity of these changes by spurring you to consider how matters of foreign travel, higher education, and spirituality intersect with your career. Big shifts are afoot: some may think about returning to university or investing in a new course of study, while others may seek to integrate mystical methods into their vocational path. A choice few may gestate grand plans to work or live abroad. Count on the Mars-Uranus squares to help you feel increasingly comfortable with striking out on a new path, one that will better reflect your shifting sense of self.", sign_id:5)
mars_gemini = Retrograde.create(name: "mars", explanation: "It’s time to empty your energetic bin, dear Gemini: this Mars retrograde may have you seeking out alternative methods for ditching some of your demons. You may choose to ‘let go and let God,’ or, just let go altogether; an emanating sense of wisdom may lead you to relinquish your need for control in preference of peace. Others yet may find themselves exiting unsustainable joint ventures or weighing up how well certain spiritual edicts and teachers are at replenishing your soul’s coffers. Any ideas circulating about an investment in continuing education or foreign fancies could suddenly go off the boil. Though some of these postponements may be frustrating at first, there also seems to be a potent opportunity to discharge your vessel of what is no longer needed and refill it with something higher-minded. As part of this, the Mars-Uranus squares will help you identify with laser-precision what parts of your psyche (and even, your clan) are working for or against your betterment.", sign_id:6)
mars_cancer = Retrograde.create(name: "mars", explanation: "There are truly some things money cannot buy, Cancer, and chief among these is love. ‘Money talks’ is an oft-used axiom because it’s true: where we most want to play, we’ll happily pay, and if we won’t cough up the cash, it’s a likely indication that our heart lies elsewhere. Be prepared for conversations about joint resources, pooled efforts, and serious partnerships, as Mars’ retrograde in Aquarius and Capricorn provokes the delicate balance between you, your partners, and the bank. Although this is most likely to crop up in romantic partnerships, the same scenarios could arise in business alliances, too. Possible areas of conflict and subsequent compromise will include divorce settlements, investments, inheritances, and the no-longer-hidden emotions underpinning these arrangements. Included in that may be considering the all-too-important loans you hand out of your time and energy – priceless assets deserving of a fair ROI. To that end, the Mars-Uranus squares will have you hopefully chasing after new aspirations with intensity, a helpful fix for breaking out of stifling arrangements.", sign_id:7)
mars_leo = Retrograde.create(name: "mars", explanation: "Leo is in the hot seat for much of the Mars retrograde; it will be nigh on impossible to escape some levels of confrontation during this time, even if that happens primarily within yourself. While that may seem like sour news, the Mars retrograde will also helpfully flush out long-held resentments that have been bubbling below the surface for far too long. In particular, you could find yourself in a contentious stand-off with colleagues and subordinates at work; similar showdowns could just as easily transpire with your better half. As you begin to release yourself from old hurts, new spaces will open within, enabling you to redirect your energy to far worthier purposes. The Mars-Uranus squares will provide the needed get-up-and-go to help power you forward into meaningful and much-needed career changes, which will benefit you long after this Mars retrograde ends.", sign_id:8)
mars_virgo = Retrograde.create(name: "mars", explanation: "Nothing passes under your keen eye easily: separating the wheat from the chaff is your full-time job as a Virgo. Fortunately, or unfortunately, this is the way you approach all areas of life, even leisure. During the Mars retrograde in Aquarius and Capricorn, you may surmise that all work and no play is making you a very dull maiden. After ticking a box or two regarding your health (which you have a natural tendency to safeguard), you’ll be in fine position to remind yourself that enjoyment, health, and work are not such strange bedfellows; perhaps they can even be considered a complementary set.The Mars-Uranus squares will drive you to reach beyond the mundane, and even the entertaining, for higher-minded wisdom that’s sure to enrich your daily beat.", sign_id:9)
mars_libra = Retrograde.create(name: "mars", explanation: "Trying to get people-pleasing behaviors out of socially canny Librans is like trying to get eggs out of a baked cake, but with varying aspects coming your way during the Mars retrograde in Aquarius and Capricorn, you may decide for once to shove your diplomacy to the side in favor of decidedly more direct tactics. The start of the Mars retrograde is more likely to bring positive adaptations to circumstances involving children, creativity, and sex; the second phase of the retrograde, however, may demand you to step up and face challenges regarding family and home. Both periods are likely to push your buttons as it becomes necessary to examine what you’re busily creating or nurturing, and who is (or is not) chipping in to help. Use the Mars-Uranus squares to assert your needs, highlighting where and when the time, energy, or cash of others is required.", sign_id:10)
mars_scorpio = Retrograde.create(name: "mars", explanation: "Home is where the heart is, Scorpio, but it’s where the mind resides, too. So much of our inner peace depends on the home we were raised in, as well as the one that we make for ourselves later in life. This Mars retrograde, you may be weighing up how home, community, and even siblings, contribute to your sense of wellbeing. Necessary course corrections will become clear as you navigate through the muck, noting when it’s time to leave certain scars behind in favor of reconciliation. Writing or journaling could be just the ticket to aid you in this release. The Mars-Uranus squares unfolding between one part of your chart involving family and home, and another part involving significant others might manifest as dramatic showdowns, but only if you let your infamous talents for impalement do their worst. Attempt to find a middle path, somewhere between antipathy and apathy, allowing you to focus on manifesting change with parents and paramours.", sign_id:11)
mars_sagittarius = Retrograde.create(name: "mars", explanation: "This Mars retrograde you’re likely to have your mind on your money, and your money on your mind, Sagittarius. The effects of the Mars retrograde in Aquarius and Capricorn are likely to be mild, but that doesn’t mean they won’t be meaningful: use the messages you intercept about money to make necessary adjustments in your communications and thoughts about the same. If your work involves writing or speaking, there is an even greater likelihood that you need to rethink your rate or fine-tune what you’re saying and why (perhaps an all too common predicament for Sagittarians). Your mantra for the series of Mars-Uranus squares is to pray for a pause button before you click send on anything that may be divisive or extraneously contentious. Use that extra energy to discover ways that you can serve your community, a win-win for both body and mind.", sign_id:12)

venus_capricorn = Retrograde.create(name: "venus", explanation: "The more things change, the more they stay the same; the typical Capricorn instinctively prefers what’s routine or expected, even when the changes in question are for their own good. You’ve had lots of change of late, with Saturn, Pluto and part of this summer’s Mars retrograde whittling away at your steely reserves. The release valve for a lot of these pressures may have pushed you to cultivate or deepen friendships and group alliances; alongside that, you may have started to envision a wide, new horizon of possibilities for yourself. Now is the time to get down to brass tacks and assess which friends – and even, which dreams – are worth your time. As the retrograde continues, apply that same filter to your career, taking note of how the most viable of your new aspirations may affect your long-term career moves.", sign_id:1)
venus_aquarius = Retrograde.create(name: "venus", explanation: "What we do in our career isn’t nearly important as whether it dovetails with our personal beliefs. Achieving fulfillment at work is derived from having an in-built sense of purpose that supersedes any menial day-to-day tasks. As an Aquarian, it’s likely your worldview already evokes a broad-minded, collective vision; the Venus retrograde will seek to remind you of this and gently nudge you towards finding ways to fold this mentality into your career long-term. If you’ve been experiencing tensions at the workplace – likely, with the eclipses happening affecting that space over the last eighteen months – Venus’ retrograde into Libra may reconnect you with the healing power of spiritual pursuits and long-distance travel. The bottom line: don’t forget your day job, Aquarius, but if you can manage it, don’t forget your daydream, either.", sign_id:2)
venus_pisces = Retrograde.create(name: "venus", explanation: "This Venus retrograde brings with it wisdom that perhaps only Pisces can readily accept, let alone integrate. As a sign of profound feeling and compassion, you’re no stranger to pain; one naturally begets the other. During the Venus retrograde, you’ll be reminded that pain has a distinct value in our journey: often, it sets us on our path, and later keeps us on it if we try to stray. And for many on the spiritual path, pain is the ultimate teacher. In a sense, there is an invitation from the Venus retrograde to see your pain through eyes of love. On a more mundane level, there could be a necessity to look at the value of spiritual or academic pursuits and how they do or do not help us overcome our deepest fears; others may find themselves wondering if power dynamics experienced with teachers and guides are worth the time and energy.", sign_id:3)
venus_aries = Retrograde.create(name: "venus", explanation: "Aries will be thanking its lucky stars this autumn for all the bravery and power already pre-built into their sign. You’ll need this and more during this Venus retrograde, as you’ll be pulled into studying the power dynamics that underpin your romantic and business relationships. This may include the why’s and how’s of divvying up cold hard cash, but it may just as likely involve taking a cold, hard look at how much you’ve been receiving in return for the gift of your time and energy. As Venus continues to retrograde into Libra, don’t give up the chase: now is the time to assess any divergent values that threaten your most important partnerships and renegotiate accordingly.", sign_id:4)
venus_taurus = Retrograde.create(name: "venus", explanation: "Taurus is already in an accelerated state of learning about the balance between self and other; the Venus retrograde is going to push this learning to yet another level. Most of the Venus retrograde will have you pondering who you’re linked with romantically. Take time to study your most intimate connections, before the retrograde takes you elsewhere: namely, to the office. As Venus continues to retrograde in Libra, it may be time to reconsider how you interact with colleagues and workplace reports, as well as revisiting your daily health routine (or lack thereof).", sign_id:5)
venus_gemini = Retrograde.create(name: "venus", explanation: "If you’ve been wondering how to find the middle ground between work and play, this Venus retrograde will feel particularly timely. Starting off in a part of your chart that involves work, service, and health, you may feel pushed to reevaluate what really matters to you in these areas; you may refine why you do what you do at work, or refine the amount of time and energy you give to it (even so you have the time to dedicate to your health). As the retrograde progresses, it will be necessary, and fun, to reconnect with your creativity and remember the importance pleasure plays in the health of mind, body, and spirit.", sign_id:6)
venus_cancer = Retrograde.create(name: "venus", explanation: "With the Venus retrograde occurring in the super-sexy part of your chart dedicated to, well, sex, it’s likely you’ll have a lot on your plate (or in your bed) during this Venus retrograde. You may reconnect with old flames or strike up with hot new ones – just know that some of these characters may not be around once Venus stations direct; apportion your time and energy accordingly (and play safe). Other areas of focus may include the powerful value of your creative pursuits, children, and pleasure in general. Once Venus retrogrades into Libra, your focus will be taken to the home front, where you can revisit plans to beautify your space, just remember to plan now and buy post-retrograde.", sign_id:7)
venus_leo = Retrograde.create(name: "venus", explanation: "Leo has been getting it from every corner, what with the eclipses occurring across your sign over the past eighteen months, and this summer’s Mars retrograde happening predominantly in the sign across from yours. Further growth at home and changes in your career may have upped the ante past the point of containment, but fear not: the Venus retrograde will likely only augment the value you’re currently placing on cementing a strong home base to help weather these storms. You may also revisit the value of family time if you’ve been overdoing it at the office (or just ignoring your mom’s calls). As the Venus retrograde continues, siblings and extended family may become a topic of reevaluation, alongside how you can best manage to communicate your values, whether written or spoken.", sign_id:8)
venus_virgo = Retrograde.create(name: "venus", explanation: "Oh, to be a Virgo: always prepared and on time, with your manicured hand raised with the answer to the pop question. Your famous talent for self-containment, which allows you to be so well-prepared, has only one unfortunate side effect: it often takes you out of the mix as you attend to your burgeoning to-do list. Now, however, is the moment to get back into your community and remember the value of your environs. That might mean heading to your local block party, or penciling in time with your neighbors, aunties, and siblings. Equally important could be recognizing the efforts you put into communications and the daily rituals you use to settle your mind. As the Venus retrograde continues, your exacting nature will come in handy for taking a red pen to your household budgets (and even, a pair of scissors to your credit cards).", sign_id:9)
venus_libra = Retrograde.create(name: "venus", explanation: "Eventually, the Venus retrograde will return to your sign, but first, she’ll have to make a visit to the part of your chart involving incoming cash to sort out how much you’re getting, and most importantly, how much you think you’re worth. Now’s the time to get serious about reviewing the price you attach to your talents and skills; if applicable, you may even start building a case for a raise – which would be best done post-Venus retrograde. As Venus retrogrades into Libra, this study of value will extend to your good self (you’re really quite good, don’t you think?).", sign_id:10)
venus_scorpio = Retrograde.create(name: "venus", explanation: "All the expansion you’ve been experiencing for the past year is coming up for review: this is nowhere near the end of your journey, dear Scorpio, but it is the right moment to take stock of how much you’ve grown recently. Could it be useful to use the Venus retrograde, occurring partially in your sign, to remind yourself of your own innate, inalienable value? Once you’re done with that exercise, you’ll be challenged to study the other side of the lens and take into consideration all the many ways you may still be inadvertently tripping yourself up. As part of this process, don’t be afraid to carve out ‘me’ time as required to make the best use of this Venus retrograde.", sign_id:11)
venus_sagittarius = Retrograde.create(name: "venus", explanation: "Normally chirpy, on-the-move Sagittarians may find themselves pulled into a mindset of retreat come the Venus retrograde. Perhaps you’ve been burning the candle at both ends, in typical Centaur fashion, or maybe you need some time out to focus on untangling some deep-seated issues. Either way, you’re likely to come out of this period feeling renewed and refreshed, with a new sense of respect for downtime. As the Venus retrograde continues, try and apply that energy to your friendship groups and associations, taking note of which ones fill up your cup and which ones suck you dry. Bonus points if you realize a friend may be something much more.", sign_id:12)

jupiter_capricorn = Retrograde.create(name: "jupiter", explanation: "As Jupiter stations retrograde in your twelve house, pay attention to your dreams, your intuition, and a growing knowing. You have big ideas and dreams. But you’re also becoming aware of subconscious fears—and perhaps a need for healing. We are only as sick as our secrets. You’re not a child anymore and have the authority to make choices in your life. You needn’t tell the whole world your business, but keep partners informed on a need to know basis. It will require teamwork and a daily process of communication, but you can manifest a vision. It starts with making healthier choices daily.", sign_id:1)
jupiter_aquarius = Retrograde.create(name: "jupiter", explanation: "Jupiter stations retrograde in your eleventh house of friends, community, social network, and fulfillment of wishes. You’re learning something about a friendship, or something that you’ve long aspired to, asking you to clarify your values and realign with the truth in your heart. All hope is far from lost. Acknowledge your desires, aspirations, acknowledge the ones you’ve outgrown, and avoid arguing for your limitations. There’s a creative and loving solution to a dilemma you face. You’re free to make a choice—and may find you don’t even have to. Just do your best to be honest.", sign_id:2)
jupiter_pisces = Retrograde.create(name: "jupiter", explanation: "Jupiter stations retrograde in your tenth house of career, profession, ambition, and public image. You may be having second thoughts about a goal you once felt sure about. You needn’t fear opportunity slipping you by. If something is right, it will meet you down the road. Financially and emotionally, you’re safe. But what do you want to be known for? What does an ambition mean to you? You’re reconnecting with a long-forgotten ambition. This is not about fame, or success, but what you have to give back to the world—it’s a lot. Rise above your insecurities and have more faith in yourself.", sign_id:3)
jupiter_aries = Retrograde.create(name: "jupiter", explanation: "Jupiter retrogrades in your ninth house, highlighting themes surrounding international travel, higher education, legal matters, philosophy, psychology, publishing, religion, and spirituality. You’re approaching a crossroads, offering a chance for course corrections. You have freedom—but what do you want, and where are you going? Be very honest with yourself and keep sight of the big picture. You don’t know it all, but stay curious and open-minded, and you can learn what you need to make wise choices. At its essence, this is a spiritual journey, realigning you with your inner compass and rediscovering your faith. The journey is the destination and you’re being guided.", sign_id:4)
jupiter_taurus = Retrograde.create(name: "jupiter", explanation: "Jupiter stations retrograde in your eight house, suggesting there are huge changes unfolding in a financial situation, sexual partnership, marriage, or something that feels larger than life. You’re not powerless and have a choice. But first clarify a dream, your values, and the true value of what’s being exchanged. There’s more potential in a situation than you think. But if you feel divided, investigate, before you make life-changing decisions. This is a chance to make choices that take you closer to a dream of financial or personal freedom. Believe in yourself and have faith—the situation is evolving as it needs to.", sign_id:5)
jupiter_gemini = Retrograde.create(name: "jupiter", explanation: "Jupiter entered your relationship zone late last year, opening the door to relationships that have the ability expand your world and be positive influences. As Jupiter stations retrograde, you’re learning information, asking for a deep reevaluation of your one-to-one relationships. If partners seem like they are stalling or backtracking, avoid premature judgment for better or worse. You can have the freedom, commitment and the security you desire. Be honest with yourself first, the better to allow you to be honest with others, and open to receive the love and support that is present. You are loved, protected, and deeply cared for—even if it doesn’t always seem that way.", sign_id:6)
jupiter_cancer = Retrograde.create(name: "jupiter", explanation: "Jupiter stations retrograde in your sixth house of work, selfless service, daily routines, and health—mental, emotional, physical, and most importantly spiritual. Changes at work, a health matter, or in your life are asking you to step back to look at the bigger picture. You have a lot to give. But does your life give you joy? Or do you feel like you’re living a double life? Acknowledge a secret ambition, any subconscious fears that limit you, what needs healing, and eliminate what doesn’t serve a greater purpose. You can live a life that is rewarding and aligns with an inner truth. Believe in yourself and you can find a way.", sign_id:7)
jupiter_leo = Retrograde.create(name: "jupiter", explanation: "As Jupiter moves retrograde in your fifth house over the next four months, this transit marks a phase of a deeper process of self-discovery and journey into your heart. You’re gaining perspective on your life, a long-term goal, and the way forward to freedom. Creatively, sexually, personally—you can have what you want. And you have gifts, talents, and desires you haven’t fully explored yet. Children too have a lot to teach you. You needn’t worry about what the world thinks of you. What matters is that you’re being true to yourself. You’re creating your life in every moment. Learn to love and have more faith in yourself. You’re already free.", sign_id:8)

As you regain perspective, you can free yourself of patterns and a burden that has weighed on you. The present is not the past, and you have the authority to make choices that align with your highest goals. It may call on you to rediscover deeper reserves of faith.

What and whom do you believe? Why? What do you want? This is the quest for a deeper truth, which begins with being honest with yourself. Communication is highlighted, and you’re learning that kindness, honesty, and compassion are equally important. Sometimes it may be wise to say nothing at all and just listen.

Whatever your current bank balance or relationship status, realize you can’t take your money to the grave, and all relationships either change or die. It’s the love you share that matters. You have a lot to give the world and your relationships: creatively, financially, and emotionally.  You can have the financial and personal freedom and security you desire.

But are you being motivated by fear or love? You are protected and have gifts and talents that you take for granted—and the treasures of the world at your feet. The only thing to fear now is fear itself. This is your chance to realign with an indivisible truth within and allow it to guide you.

saturn_capricorn = Retrograde.create(name: "saturn", explanation: "The pressure’s off, for now, dear Sea-Goats. With Saturn transiting your sign, and your first house, you may have been feeling the cold burn of Saturn as he compressed your vitality and forced you to face up to uncomfortable home truths about who you are (versus who you wish you were). The good news is that with a little bit of elbow grease and a dash of humility, this transit will fortify your sense of self and set you up for success, especially in the face of adversity. Now that Saturn is in retrograde, it’s as if he has back turned to you. Though that may feel like the cat’s away and the mice can play, in reality, mean-daddy Saturn has a set of eyes in the back of the head. Whatever you do, don’t lose focus now; while Saturn’s power is on the wane, let your self-stewardship take an even more serious turn.", sign_id:1)
saturn_aquarius = Retrograde.create(name: "saturn", explanation: "The part of your chart currently hosting Saturn, the twelfth house, is sometimes jokingly referred to as the dustbin of the natal chart. That, however, quite significantly underscores the seriousness of this part of the chart, which can deal with acts of self-sabotage, retreat, isolation, and the murky waters of our subconscious. With Saturn here, you may find yourself withdrawing from external life or knee-deep in serious self-study. As part of the Saturn in Capricorn retrograde, you may reconsider the different coping mechanisms you have in place to deal with the ups and downs of life. If you have any doubts about your style of self-soothing, the best bet would be to find a reliable guide to help you on your way – all the better if this person is Saturnine: serious, accomplished, and paternal.", sign_id:2)

As he entered your eleventh house of friends and groups late last year, you may have found yourself weighing up the value of certain friendships. Some likely feel more parts burdensome than bountiful, or you may find yourself retracting from group settings altogether. During the Saturn retrograde in Capricorn transit, revisit the privilege of human connection, and decide which ones are worth the work, and which are on their way out. Equally, if you define yourself in any way with a collective effort, there may be a powerful revisitation of your attachments and responsibilities to the group, whether those be political or personal.", sign_id:3)

As part of this transit, you may also put a foot wrong (or two) and learn some much-needed lessons about taking the slow, baby steps towards your goals that Aries usually attempts to sidestep. With time the result will be an inner peace which blooms from within only when we act with integrity. During Saturn’s retrograde in Capricorn, take time to meet with your brand management, even if that’s just a party of one, to set out an action plan that will make the angels weep.

Saturn transiting the ninth house of your chart, a lofty, otherworldly place filled with dreams and visions, foreign travel and higher education, may nudge you toward taking journeys of soul and spirit. For some, that may mean returning to school; others may find themselves taking a pew or studying the stars. As part of this process, you may hit the wall with different systems of beliefs or be pushed to walk your spiritual talk. Either way, you’re in for a trip. During the Saturn retrograde in Capricorn, you may take yourself on an internal trek to meditate on where you want all this wandering to lead.

True, too, that this part of the chart holds some of our darkest demons. Fear not, however: Saturn’s transit here will help you both rationalize your fears and ration your riches. Part of this transit may involve mucking into how power is divvied up; this may involve managing inheritances, investments, or spending increased time with your tax accountant. When Saturn retrogrades in Capricorn, you’ll have ample opportunity to revisit the financial structures underpinning your partnerships. Money being a close cousin of control, you also may end up exploring how these two concepts intertwine within your psyche.", sign_id:6)

Part of Saturn’s presence in this delicate part of your chart might entail getting seriously committed – putting a ring on it, for example – but for other folks, Saturn’s entry here may make us say sayonara to that special someone. Before you make a hasty exit, though, try a little patience: Saturn’s not trying to ruin your love life, he’s only aiming to inject it with a dose of reality. The Saturn retrograde in Capricorn is an opportune moment to reflect on the level of responsibility you bring to relationships. Too much, and we feel burdened, too little, and our partners feel neglected.

Positively, Saturn here may force us to face up to our health and make necessary adjustments, all the better, of course, if you can aim to make such changes voluntarily and not only when your hand is being forced. There may also be a need to chop wood, carry water in pursuit of honing your skills. During the Saturn retrograde in Capricorn, you may be reminded that wellbeing won’t be attained by one-off juice fasts or gimmicky short-cuts; real health is the balance of body and mind, brought about only by small, incremental actions made on the daily. Health challenges, if any exist, may relent during this period, giving you an opportunity to investigate their source more deeply.", sign_id:8)

Saturn here may very well constrain our access to the kinds of indulgent feel-goods associated with the fifth house, but he’s just as likely to bring us into better, healthier relationship with them, too. If our boundaries to lovers or luxuries have kept us in a state of disarray, Saturn will ensure that we find a way to enjoy ourselves without devolving into destructive habits. You’ll likely be on board with this agenda, seeing as Virgo loves nothing more than self-improvement. Use the time of Saturn’s retrograde in Capricorn to discern – one of your many talents – where the boundaries currently sit, and where they really ought to lie.

Some of you may be focused on buying, renovating, or even downsizing a home (Saturn loves a contraction!), while others may head back to the mothership to take care of family matters. Recent transits instilled you with a growing sense of who you are and what you deserve; the Saturn retrograde in Capricorn is the perfect time to bring that rhetoric home to roost. Faced with a shifting foundation in-house or home, as well as added responsibilities, reviewing your boundaries with family may become all-important. Use this time wisely to meditate on how you can best support your loved ones without losing the plot.", sign_id:10)

Part of this will be ensuring that you recognize the enormous responsibility of carrying messages out into the world. It hardly matters whether this communiqué happens in our living room or across radio waves – if we say it, we need to be able to stand by it. This transit also has to do with being a part of a community and striking the right tone as a matter of true respect and not just paying lip service. During the Saturn in Capricorn retrograde, eek out some mental space to sit down and grade yourself on your progress thus far.

It’s time to get serious about your source of funds, pronto. New pressures may have arrived, constraining your earnings, or you may be slowly building towards new ways of making it rain. Whichever scenario applies, Sag is uniquely positioned to use the Saturn retrograde in Capricorn as a review of all things finance: dollars, dineros, bitcoins – if you can name it, it’s time to count and account for it.", sign_id:12)

Some may have faced huge, no-turning-back changes in their personality, while others may have faced challenges maintaining their health or energy levels. The Pluto retrogrades in Capricorn will provide you with ample breathing space to explore just how well these transformations of body and persona are going; with careful introspection, you can take stock of just how far you’ve come – and how much further you wish to go.", sign_id:1)
pluto_aquarius = Retrograde.create(name: "pluto", explanation: "It’s been said that there is no good time for a Pluto transit, just an appropriate one; Aquarians that have tussled long-term with Pluto in Capricorn inhabiting one of the trickiest parts of the natal chart may be more than inclined to agree. In some ways, Pluto is likely at home in the twelfth house, where we find hidden enemies, addictions, self-sabotage, and the deep, cavernous seat of our subconscious. Pluto acts like a dark mirror, reflecting all that we would normally avoid seeing, and for that, we must be thankful. To know who we are, warts and all, and to accept those ‘lesser’ parts of our being, is a radical act of compassion. As you continue on this journey, employ the Pluto retrogrades as much-needed pit stops to ground yourself and refuel, before heading ever deeper into yourself.", sign_id:2)
pluto_pisces = Retrograde.create(name: "pluto", explanation: "As Pluto in Capricorn continues its transit of your eleventh house of groups, friends, hopes, and aspirations, you may have been undergoing intense transformation through key friendships or collectives. Truth be told, this is one of the least difficult houses to host a Pluto transit, being that its significations are so sunny and optimistic. All the same, Pluto has set out a rigorous syllabus for you. As part of his passage in this house, you may have completely upended your ideas about the friends and groups that dominate your calendar. This has likely involved cutting cords with old comrades or undergoing tremendous shifts with particular pals; you may have even found yourself pitched into a circle of powerful movers and shakers. During the Pluto retrograde in Capricorn, aim to review this transformational path, ensuring that whoever you align yourself with has the same heartfelt intentions as yourself.", sign_id:3)
pluto_aries = Retrograde.create(name: "pluto", explanation: "Since 2008, Pluto in Capricorn’s transit of your tenth house of career and reputation may have put you in the hot seat more than a handful of times, forcing you to grapple with internal and external power struggles as you forge ahead at work. Shadow material in relation to your career might have also surfaced, bringing into question what you do and why; some may have been weighing up equally important questions about notoriety, fame, and even their mothers (a tenth house affair). As Pluto retrogrades in Capricorn, you’ll be able to squeeze the best from this transit if you can delve below the surface, refining your career aspirations and positioning your power in only the worthiest of vessels.", sign_id:4)

With Pluto in Capricorn transiting your ninth house of spirituality, religion, foreign places and people, you may have found your normal cure-all in short supply or sorely lacking. Pluto is pushing you to manifest true abiding faith in the face of an existence that can sometimes feel meaningless. Faith is not just knowing that all will be well eventually, but that the intransient moments of pain serve a purpose, too, even if we cannot always understand what that purpose may be. The Pluto retrogrades in Capricorn can help nudge you along the hermit’s path, enabling you to seek grounded, immoveable answers to some of life’s biggest questions.", sign_id:5)

Since then, you may have been psychically pushed to the edge of your threshold or had to deal with more than your fair share of death and rebirth. True, too, however, that the intensity of Pluto’s transits may have gifted you an ultra-acute sense of how money and power can intertwine to toxic effect, and how to best avoid the pull of such slippery slopes. As Pluto retrogrades in Capricorn, you can expect to ruminate further on getting to the root cause of all that threatens to unseat you in matters of money and mentality.", sign_id:6)
pluto_cancer = Retrograde.create(name: "pluto", explanation: "All is fair in love and war, especially where Pluto is concerned. Pluto in Capricorn’s transit of your seventh house, the sacred space of coupledom and committed partners, is teaching you just how much war seethes beneath the surface of even the most blissfully loved up duos. In this transit, you may have to work on healing any deep-seated wounding that allows toxicity to infiltrate your relationships; in particular, Pluto has a penchant for jealousy, betrayal, manipulation, and its closest cousin, gaslighting. During the Pluto retrograde in Capricorn, turn your attention inwards, deconstructing how you may be aiding or abetting the devolution of your partnerships. It’s not pretty, but it’s purposeful – leave no stone unturned if you want raw, authentic love.", sign_id:7)
pluto_leo = Retrograde.create(name: "pluto", explanation: "Pluto has been grinding away in a part of your chart dedicated to the daily grind for the better part of a decade; the results of this reckoning may have profoundly impacted you, body, and spirit. On one hand, you may be well on your way to discovering exactly what kind of work or service it is you feel most pulled to proffer, on the other hand, you may have been feeling like your life is encased in drudgery (it is worth noting that the sixth house used to signify indentured servitude). Equally possible is that you will have been tested, again and again, to move towards an ever-deepening relationship to your health. The Pluto retrogrades in Capricorn will afford you more time to get to the root of and generate holistic answers to all these challenges.", sign_id:8)
pluto_virgo = Retrograde.create(name: "pluto", explanation: "Pluto in Capricorn plundering around in the house of the chart normally reserved for fun and frivolity has been no picnic. Pluto’s excoriating gaze burns through anything superficial, which is especially problematic when he travels in the fifth house, which embodies the relatively shallow pleasantries and indulgences of life, whether that is found in the laughter of children or the sighs of our lovers. Light-hearted fun may have been a challenging energy to tap into this transit, and there may have also been traumatic upheavals in the realms of sex, children, and creative pursuits. The Pluto retrogrades in Capricorn provide a small window of opportunity to allow yourself to lean back and breathe a little bit easier, and if you can, to remind yourself that all work and no play is no way to live. Life is for the living.", sign_id:9)
pluto_libra = Retrograde.create(name: "pluto", explanation: "Having had Pluto in Capricorn for such an extended time in your fourth house, the part of the chart that describes our roots, childhood, family, and especially our fathers, you may feel as if the psychological study of your origin story and its impact on your life is never-ending. Here, Pluto is testing your ability to see family for what it is, minus the pretty facades. Just as important is internalizing just how necessary some of the failings of family life can be for our personal growth and transformation. If you’re amid delving deeper into family narratives or muddling through home turf drama, the Pluto retrograde in Capricorn transit can be a boon time for studying your posse through Pluto’s razor-sharp lens. Seek not to assign blame, which will only victimize yourself or others, but to build stronger ties based on brutal truth.", sign_id:10)
pluto_scorpio = Retrograde.create(name: "pluto", explanation: "Pluto has been playing around in a many-splendored area of your chart: the third house embodies everything from siblings and neighbors to communication and short-distance travel. Some may be called to step up their relationships with brothers and sisters (as well as aunties and the like), a shift that may be necessary if any underhandedness presents itself in these relationships. More likely, your processes of thought and speech are undergoing a serious rework. Powerful ways of communicating may be emerging, and you may be applying that newfound voice to causes connected to your community. The Pluto retrogrades in Capricorn are a time to revisit the power of words. If you’re in doubt about the integrity of your communications, hit the pause button until you better understand your deeper motives – what you say is just as important as why you say it.", sign_id:11)
pluto_sagittarius = Retrograde.create(name: "pluto", explanation: "The second house, where we currently find transiting Pluto, is our personal bank. Although more euphemistic understandings of this house include our sense of self-esteem and our talents, the core of this house’s significations are tied up in greenbacks. Having Pluto here is not easy. There is an indelible link between what we earn and how we feel about ourselves. Hosting a Plutonian obstacle in our house of funds is enough to derail anyone, even the eternally optimistic Sagittarian. Keep the faith. By transit’s end, you’ll have earned a consummate education in money, both in how it corrupts, and how it empowers. With that knowledge in tow, you’ll be able to control your finances instead of being controlled by them. Use the Pluto retrogrades in Capricorn to consider how the modern worship of money may be disconnecting us from what’s truly valuable, as well as studying how well you’re adapting to your new role as money master.", sign_id:12)

neptune_capricorn = Retrograde.create(name: "neptune", explanation: "Perhaps this is optimistic on my part, but I’m inclined to believe that Neptune transiting the third house can be one of the more productive, helpful ways to experience Neptune’s powers of dissolution. Primarily, the third house relates to writing and communicating; positively, Neptune can help open us to preternatural levels of creativity, drenching our spoken and written words with palpable sentiment. The third house also embodies other topics, however, which may have been less fanciful. Traditionally, the third house encompasses siblings and family member just beyond our immediate family, as well as our neighborhood and short-distance travel. At worst, we may have discovered that our siblings have hidden agendas; other possibilities include a failure to erect appropriate boundaries with the same. Since the connection between your sign and Neptune is mostly beneficial, it’s also likely that you may have received a helping, healing hand from your family. Artists and creators can use the Neptune retrogrades for plunging deep into Neptune’s well in search of inspiration. The remaining Capricorns will benefit just as nicely by actively letting go of fantasy and leaning into healing.", sign_id:1)
neptune_aquarius = Retrograde.create(name: "neptune", explanation: "It seems you may have been busily building sandcastles in the air these past few years, dear Aquarius. This imaginative output is part of your modus operandi: inventive and future-focused, you approach every project with more than a nod of Promethean purposefulness, studying every angle and rebuilding things anew – and always for the best. Typically, this would be all well and fine, but with Neptune transiting your second house of earned income, there may have been one or two hiccups involving your personal finances. Perhaps you overestimated your ROI, or maybe you invested big when you should have run in the opposite direction; some may have faced fiscal treacheries. Others may have become overly attached to material security, hoping that their beefy bank balance may somehow magically ensure their physical security, too. As the pressures of Neptune’s waves recede during the retrograde, you’ll be better placed to make clear-headed decisions about your financial plans, hedging your bets as needed. For now, keep in mind that money is one of the greatest illusions of all – so treat it accordingly.", sign_id:2)
neptune_pisces = Retrograde.create(name: "neptune", explanation: "Neptune’s transit through your sign and the all-important first house may have left you feeling as if the edges of your being have eroded, leaving you exposed to the elements. Neptune transits can be notoriously hard to articulate, and in your case, there may be a sense that your most basic identity – who you are and what you’re about – is somehow just out of reach, evading your grasp. You may have reached this point after many well-meaning attempts to better yourself, chasing the ideal and holding yourself against impossibly high, chimerical standards; the resulting failures to transcend yourself may have been brutal and enlightening. Any lingering suppositions you may have had about the separations between yourself and others have now been rendered well and truly void. The Neptune retrogrades in Pisces may be a welcome respite from this deep-reaching spiritual work. As the fog lifts, and the erosions slow, take note of what parts of you remain steadfast and true, even in the face of certain dissolution.", sign_id:3)
neptune_aries = Retrograde.create(name: "neptune", explanation: "Neptune’s transit in Pisces has kept it slushing through a particularly murky part of your birth chart, the twelfth house. While some naturally associate this area of the chart with transcendence and healing, a more realistic rendering of this house’s meaning includes habits of self-undoing and addiction. The twelfth house embodies who we are when the lights go out. Importantly, Aries, this transit could have brought new levels of self-compassion to your subconscious psyche and helped you find new ways to gently approach and disarm your most ruthless acts of self-sabotage. During this worthy tour of your innermost quarters, you may have teetered back and forth from spiritual high to resignation, meeting yourself as both curer and co-conspirator of your ills. Herein lies the rub: even in the deepest folds of shadow, there is a light of equal measure waiting to emerge. As Neptune retrogrades, focus on this light, reminding yourself that nothing is quite so dark as it may seem.", sign_id:4)
neptune_taurus = Retrograde.create(name: "neptune", explanation: "Benjamin Franklin famously advised to be slow in making friends, and even slower in changing them; with Neptune having inhabited the part of your chart dedicated to friends and groups for quite some time, you may feel he missed the mark with those words, Taurus. Neptune’s presence here may have dished out painful deceptions involving friends, forcing you to reconsider to re-qualify the line separating friend from foe. Others may have encountered collectives and co-ops which at first glance seemed infused with sunshine and happiness, but which were found to be made of lesser stuff upon closer study. Ultimately, this is a lesson in self-reliance: while being one of many is all fine and dandy, in the end, we are all a party of one. Look to the Neptune retrogrades for help in finding the promised land within you (or a friend or two).", sign_id:5)
neptune_gemini = Retrograde.create(name: "neptune", explanation: "Many of us derive our most basic of identity from what we ‘do’: our careers. Having Neptune in your tenth house, itself linked with career and reputation, may seem like a cruelly destabilizing ride, Gemini. You may feel unsettled and ill at ease about your given profession or unsure of where you’re headed. In truth, much good can come of this transit: being temporarily derailed from your career aspirations can be hugely frustrating but may also serve to deliver you to a career path much more closely aligned to your authentic self. Neptune’s transits always topple fantasies, so if you’ve been holding onto to dreams that are distinctly past their sell-by date, no is the time to release these old dreams back into the ethers. For a small bunch of folks, however, Neptune here can bring notoriety and even relative levels of celebrity, although you’ll still need to keep both eyes peeled for Neptune’s unsavory connections with dramatics falls from grace. Wherever you’re at on your career path, the Neptune retrogrades in Pisces can be a useful salve for releasing your ego from the grips of your vocational status. Use this downtime to envision your next move while leaving the action for later.", sign_id:6)
neptune_cancer = Retrograde.create(name: "neptune", explanation: "Jesus, take the wheel: with Neptune long present in the part of your chart dedicated to spiritual sustenance, you may have found yourself sinking further and further into the cushiony embrace of a higher power, Cancer. What – or who – that higher power is matters very little. You’ll find through the Neptune transit in Pisces that there is no singularly faultless axiom, guru, text, or spiritual path. Perhaps disappointingly, all roads really do lead to Rome, which in turn means that not one road is inherently special. With that in mind, enjoy the ride: seek high and low, far and wide. Open yourself wholly to the experience of merging into the great unknown. Use the Neptune retrogrades in Pisces to help you stop focusing on finding the one true path; once you do, you’ll be more open to discovering the best path for you – and that will make all the difference.", sign_id:7)
neptune_leo = Retrograde.create(name: "neptune", explanation: "Inevitably, when things are combined, something is lost. Two becoming one has been the inspiration of alchemically-inclined romantics throughout history (as well as the Spice Girls) but in truth, the disappearing of “the one” into “the other” works much better as a poetic device than a partnership guideline. With Neptune transiting your eighth house of shared resources, this may feel particularly pertinent to you right about now. Lessons concerning your partner’s resources (or lack thereof) and their willingness to share or combine those assets to positive affect may have been a theme, as well as ideas about interdependence in romantic relationships. Fears of loss may loom large, clouding your mind with end-of-times visions; promised inheritances, and well-intentioned investments may wither on the vine. The benefit? Locating a deeper, more profound column of strength within, that depends on nothing and no one except yourself, Leo. As Neptune retrogrades in Pisces, take heart that this process is unfolding as it should. Your doubts, fears, and insecurities are all part of that, even if it doesn’t yet feel that way.", sign_id:8)
neptune_virgo = Retrograde.create(name: "neptune", explanation: "Hosting Neptune in your seventh house may have been a discomfiting match for ultra-pragmatic, grounded Virgos, whose talents for discernment are usually second to none. With Neptune transiting Pisces, the sign opposite yours, however, you may have had to reconcile on more than occasion that your normally precise judgment has landed you in murky waters. Neptune’s hazy presence in the part of the birth chart dedicated to committed partnerships may have made for less than savory happenings, blurring the edges of who is and is not to be trusted. Classically, Neptune in the seventh house can create dizzying love affairs (and business partnerships, too) which end when our sacred other is exposed as a sham. Maybe this indiscretion included betrayal or deception; maybe it amounted to no more than realizing our own projections were keeping us from seeing others as they truly are. As it stands, Virgo is quite often to play the role of helpful beta, submitting itself to serve the greater good; these Neptune transits, including the Neptune retrogrades in Pisces, are goading you into seeing that while your assistance is always appreciated, your self-sacrifice is not at all necessary.", sign_id:9)
neptune_libra = Retrograde.create(name: "neptune", explanation: "Neptune transiting the sixth house may be one of the more challenging placements: as this house holds health challenges, and Neptune confuses, you may have faced significant setbacks in vitality for which you have failed to find definitive diagnosis or treatment. Strange irritations and inflammations may have taken hold, leading you down a nebulous path towards rehabilitation, Libra. If Neptune has been kind enough to leave your body alone, however, it may have sent waves of workload your way instead. Much of this work could have kept you toiling away past all sensible limitations, at times making it hard for you to distinguish yourself from the work you do. This may have led to confusion between service and servitude; the former requires only good intention while the latter demands forfeiting your personal needs for that of your employer, project, or team. Disappointments may have also occurred with colleagues, subordinates, and even house pets, all of which are secondary significations of the sixth house. During the Neptune retrogrades, some of the relative fog surrounding confusions at work and wellness may lift just enough for you to get a little perspective.", sign_id:10)
neptune_scorpio = Retrograde.create(name: "neptune", explanation: "The play’s the thing, with Neptune mollifying your fifth house of love, creativity, children, and sex since 2011. Pleasure is a noble use of one’s time, but if it is held as a singular, unchallenged ideal, you may end up sliding into situations of just too much of a good thing. It’s equally possible that you could have found yourself putting your romantic partners up on a pedestal, long before they rightly earned such accolades. As infatuation fades and reality seeps in, as it tends to do, romances formed under the slippery auspices of rose-colored glasses tend to stumble and fall, leaving both parties disillusioned. Was it love, or just confusion, Scorpio? Romantic suffering is not the only contest you face: with Neptune transiting the fifth house, you may be a creative martyr in the making, sacrificing all for your art; since the fifth house also includes children, the same pattern of self-immolation may involve your role as a parent. Aim to elucidate as best you can the boundary between pleasure and excess throughout the Neptune retrogrades in Pisces, and attempt to find a healthy middle ground between the two.", sign_id:11)
neptune_sagittarius = Retrograde.create(name: "neptune", explanation: "Fill a house with love, the old axiom goes, and then it becomes a home. As a Sagittarius, that statement may not entirely resonate, what with your natural penchant for wanderlust and freedom; you may be more inclined to muse that home is where the heart is (a location which might change daily for you). Yet here you are, knee-deep in Neptune transiting your fourth house, where you’ve been busily unpacking the difference between house and home, as well as negotiating home truths about the nature of family, Sagittarius. Neptune’s transit in this part of your chart may have allowed you to see that four walls suffused with buckets of love can just as quickly become a prison, as it can become a home. Some may find themselves ruminating anew on family woes long past, while others sift through current melodramas; in both scenarios, you are likely to find yourself disenchanted with the gap between expectation and reality in your home life. If this seems harsh, it is, but it is also a journey worth its weight in gold: only when faced with bitter disappointments do we learn what it means to love ourselves and others unconditionally. The Neptune retrogrades in Pisces will be particularly useful for returning to your stories of origin to adjudicate what was real, and what was merely wishful thinking.", sign_id:12)
